# svg
This repository contains the HTML file for a design I manually coded exclusively using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). I made use of different shapes that can be created using SVG Drawing such as: Path, Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Polyline, and Polygon. The project showcases how SVG can be utilized to create intricate, scalable, and visually appealing designs within a single HTML file.

Features:
- Pure SVG Graphics: Every visual element on the website is crafted using SVG, ensuring high-quality and resolution-independent graphics.
- Clean and Simple Markup: The design is implemented using clean HTML and CSS, making it easy to understand and modify.
- Scalability: SVG elements maintain their clarity and sharpness at any screen size or resolution, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
- Lightweight: SVG graphics are often more lightweight compared to traditional image formats, leading to faster load times and improved performance.
